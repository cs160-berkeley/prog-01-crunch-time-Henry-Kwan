# PROG 01: Crunch Time

The application does 3 main things:
1)	Given any number of reps or minutes of a given exercise, returns how many calories you burned
2)	Given any number of reps or minutes of a given exercise, returns how much work must be done in other exercises to do burn the same number of calories
3)	Given any number of calories you want burned, return the amount of work needed to be put into other exercises to successfully burn that amount.
